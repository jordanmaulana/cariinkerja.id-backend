## ü§ñ n8n Integration

This project requires **n8n** to automatically feed job data into the database. The platform uses n8n workflows to scrape and process job listings from various sources.

### Available Workflow Nodes

The `n8n_nodes/` folder contains pre-built workflow configurations:
- **weworkremotely.json**: Workflow for scraping remote job listings from WeWorkRemotely
- **indeed.json**: Workflow for scraping job listings from Indeed

### Setting up n8n Workflows

1. Install and set up n8n on your system
2. Import the workflow files from the `n8n_nodes/` folder into your n8n instance
3. Configure the workflows with your database connection details
4. Schedule the workflows to run periodically for automatic job data updates

**Note**: These workflows are essential for populating the jobs database. Without n8n, you'll need to manually add job listings through the admin panel.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development
